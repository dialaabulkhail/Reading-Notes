# Prep: The Growth Mindset

- **A kinder, gentler philosophy of success**
 > "We are highly open to suggestions"[^1]

unfortunately that is extremely true, people get affected on what they want and how they view themselfs by the force of marketing, media, society opinions and demands and that is a very serious reason why success is so hard to achive.
I personally have been through an experience in which I found at the end of the journy that that was not what I wanted from the beginning.
 


- **The power of believing that you can improve**
this made me sad for the educational sytem at our schools, it is facinating to see that much of mind growth and abilities improvment in such short period of time only through following simple rules of "YET" education. Hope to see this learning system applied here.

- **Grit: The power of passion and perseverance**
I agree that passion,dedication, perseverance and all the things that keep you motivated are the most important in order to accomplish any work, besides, I think that is what gives everything we do fun and special.

- **Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice**
useful resources to challenge yourself and get out of your comfort zone:

 - **Assessing Bias**
1. bias and identity: i think by experience; individuals are better to be seperated form word to avoid problems on pesonal scales, also identity should'nt  affect life decisions that much, experiences and choises must have a role.
2. connect to mitigate bias: its not that i dont need support from others, but I tend to make my own decisions and face my poblems on my own out of conviction that I should hold the responsibility.
3. four ways to act with courage: this one I skipped my mistake.
4. the assessment was good to know my week points in bias subject, will work to improve what I scored lowest.

- **Emotional intelligence essessment**
1. self awareness: scored 21 
2. slef management: scored 20
3. social aareness: scored 21
4. relationship management: 24
I think my lowest score of self management is fair enough as I struggle sometimes with mood swings and emotions get mixed in a way that hinder me from taking decisions.
