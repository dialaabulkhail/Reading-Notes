# Game of Greed 2



## Big O notation
- How much time and space in memory it being consumed while an algorithm is being executed.
- It is a way to measure how the algorithm will process to increasing data in terms of time and space.
- A way of comparing different algorithm.
- Big O notation gives the worst case senario.
- Computational complexity:
1. O(1) : constant running time.
2. O(n) : linear running time.
3. O(n^k): polynomial running time.
4. O(log n): logathimic running time.
5. O(n log n): log-linear running time.
