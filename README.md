## Prep: Introduction to SQL
SQL is an abbriviation for Structured Query Language, it is a language that provides the features of storing, quering, editing, transforming and manipulating data by users, and for that it uses a relational database; relational databases depend on tables of rows and coloumns of data.
Basic query has so many keywords that are easy to deal with such as (SELECT, FROM, AND,OR,LIKE,NOT LIKE, ORDER BY , OFFSET, LIMIT, JOIN INNER, ON..)
schema in SQL is known as the database that describes what datatype do the coloumns have in the table. 
in schema we use (INSERT, INTO, VALUES, UPDATE, SET, DELETE, CREATE IF NOT EXISTS, DEFAULT, ALTER TABLE(ADD, DROP, RENAME)).
