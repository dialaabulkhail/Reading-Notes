## TensorFlow
Tenserflow is a library used to build neural networks, its used for machine learning applications easily with an API called Keras.
tensorflow was mainly used for detecting ard recognising (like traffic lights/pedestrian).
 - Applications of Tensorflow:
1. Analyzing rush-hour (peak) traffic
2. Predicting car accident risk
3. Greater knowledge of on-road conditions - like weather change
4. Driving behavior over specific roads-  for example, it uses Flow/Density models to calculate relative speeds
5. The effectiveness of safety measures

- Keras is used as a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.  [Modules](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras)
