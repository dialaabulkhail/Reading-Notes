## Big O nation
This is used to describe the complixety of an algorithm as how much time and memory it holds **O** is refered to the most complicated case

**O(1)**: fixed time/space in each time an algorithm excutes.

**O(N)**: linearly growth with data size until it reaches O (worst case).

**O(N²)**: directly proportinal to square data size "common in nested iterations".

**O(2^N)**: double growth with addition of data ex: recursive fibonacci.

**O(log N)**: little effect on growth while doubling data size

## Python-Facts and Myths 
Python is an easy, simple yet very effective programming language.
- Assignment never copies data
- Immutable types: floats, int, tuples, strings.
- Attributes: objects, lists, values & keys and anything no the left of an assignment.
- > the best way to avoid a surprise of immutable laiasing is dont mutate values, (wite function that make new lists)[^1]
- Names have no type & values have no scope.
- Python isn't called by value nor by reference, but by assignment
